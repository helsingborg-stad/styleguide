The value of the attribute must be the containers id which it should filter.</br>The container (which does not have to be direct parent if items) has to have the attribute <code>[js-filter-container]</code> whith the value of a unique id. </br></br>Apply the <code>[js-filter-item]</code> on the elements that will be filterable (e.g. a row in a table). The items should contain at least one child which has the <code>[js-filter-item]</code> attribute. The data inside that element will be used for filtering.</br></br>You can have several filterable items on one page as long as each container has a unique ID and a matching input.",
